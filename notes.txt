1. Need to build 3 classifiers with using same / different features (1 per
person)

2. What features are we looking for? 
- What fingers are held up 
- Distance of fingertip to the center of the hand 
- Which of the 5 fingers are being held up

- Derive thresholds (area ratio, angle, distance from middle, number of
  defects, (maybe also the skin threshold?)) from trianing?

- Classifiers:
1. Number of defects
2. Number of defects AND area ratio
3. Number of defects, area ratio, and the 

Use an SVM to classify the methods using multiple features?

- We could also use HoG as a feature descriptor?

- We can also use the "hand" region we determine and figure out the distance
  between boundry pixels and the center 
  - We then use this histogram of distance and put it into bins (36?)
  - Then, we can use this vector as a feature and input it into a SVM?
  -* we would want to just get the outline of the hand, and we would also want
  to fill in anything in this outline
